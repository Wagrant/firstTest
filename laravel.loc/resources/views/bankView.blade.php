Thud. The Gnome’s hand slammed down on the timepiece, one of the hands grazing the skin on his thumb.<br>

Three hours passed before the Gnome stirred from his slumber. The first thing to hit his weary brain was the throbbing pain in his hand. As the world became less and less blurry, realisation struck him. “Oh no! Not today, please, not today.” He shot upright, and began to look around franticly for the clock. The slightly bent hand pointed somewhere between the ten and eleven marks. ‘No. No. No. No. NO!’<br>

Binky was by no means special. Yes, he had abnormally large eyes, but other than that, he was just a normal Gnome. He went about his business quietly each day, deep in the lower reaches of Gnomeregan. For two years now it had been the same.Wake in the morning at eight. Make his way to the Thistlefuzz Enchanting Shop. Help ‘The Fuzz’ test new ways to infuse magic into all kinds of mechanical creations. Make his way home at the end of the day. Nothing exciting ever happened in Gnomeregan.<br>

Around eight minutes later, Binky was on the Cogwheel. This was the hub of trade in the Gnomeregan’s lower reaches. It was a sight to behold; a giant metallic cog, constantly gyrating around a huge hollow pipe. The pipe itself contained another relay of cogwheels, functioning as a lift to the higher parts of the city. The constant turning notion was nauseating to those who spent little time there. Yet Binky had grown accustomed to the perpetual motion over his time working there.<br>

Stepping gingerly onto the rotating wheel, there was only a short jog to the shop itself, but his swift pace gradually slowed to a walk, then a little more, until he was standing in the centre of the wheel, his eyes darting from building to building.<br>

Something was wrong. The Cogwheel was usually a hive of activity; Traders selling the latest in not-quite-state-of-the-art goods, Gnomes meeting to discuss the next big magical discovery, laughing, joking, talking. Yet today, Binky saw… Nothing. Now that he had actually stopped to think, he couldn’t recall seeing a single Gnome during his entire (rushed) journey so far.<br>

He began to head to the shop again, but this time more cautiously. Upon arrival, the door to the store was still closed. In the last two years ‘The Fuzz’ had never been late opening his shop. Sure he was a crazy old fool, but he knew his timekeeping. Something really strange was happening today.<br>

Binky crept up to the door, as light-footed as his small stature allowed him. “Locked!” He muttered. The sound echoed in the deserted streets around him. Luckily there was a spare key. He stooped down and reached behind the flower pot. “Got it.” He smiled as he talked to himself. “Silly fool. You can always rely on him to be predictable.” Binky unlocked the door, opened it a crack, and slid into the shop.<br>

Looking around, Binky saw nothing out of the ordinary. Papers containing the notes of arcane experiments were strewn throughout the shop. He crept up to the main desk and found a staff laid across the papers on it. ‘The old man left his staff. He must have gone in a hurry.” Binky’s words served more to reassure himself than anything. He knew nobody could hear him. He decided to check upstairs. If Thistlefuzz had really left, he would have took his famous cloak with him.<br>

The wardrobe upstairs was stiff, but eventually Binky managed to pry it open. ‘Empty! Why would he leave so unexpectedly?’<br>

Thud.<br>

“What was tha-“<br>

Thud.<br>

Before he could figure out what the sound was, he heard the wooden door break with a huge crack.<br>

“GRAAHROOH”<br>

The noise was deafening. Binky knew what it was. Even though he had never seen one, he’d heard all about the Troggs from the depths of the world. He rushed to the stairs and was hit by the smell of the thing. The stench was overwhelming; damp, like cloaks left in a heap for days after being washed. When he set eyes on the Trogg, Binky was stunned. Teeth jarring out at strange angles, a head that looked as if it had been hit far too many times, and a loincloth that was just a touch too small. He held himself from retching just long enough to see a large club in the Trogg’s hand.<br>

Before Binky had time to react, the great mass of stone and bone threw itself towards him. It narrowly missed the lithe Gnome and destroyed the shop’s banister. The Trogg shrieked in pain, a deafening wail. But there was no time to waste. The Gnome darted forward, slipped under the Trogg’s arm and made for the door. The Trogg turned; uttering what sounded like a battle cry, and threw the club towards the door. Binky ducked, the club spinning over his head and hitting the bookcase nearest the door. The Gnome tried to get out of the way but this time wasn’t nimble enough. The mass of wood and books tumbled onto him.<br>

He knew his leg was broken. “Why, oh why did I get out of bed? Now I’m going to be eaten by an angry Trogg.” The beast advanced slowly, taking great pleasure over its catch. Binky closed his eyes. He could sense the beast getting closer, its hefty body lumbering towards him. Binky’s mind was racing, desperately searching for something, anything, that could help. He heard the old man’s voice in his head. It echoed throughout his mind as he let it flow through him. “Listen up boy! This just might save your life one day!”<br>

The Trogg picked up his club once more, preparing to deliver the final blow. Images flashed through Binky’s mind. “Found it!” The spell formed in his head, mana coursing in his veins. The Trogg raised its club. Fire crackled on Binky’s tongue as he formed the spell. The flames spread through him, into his fingertips, then out, towards the Trogg.<br>

Binky hurled the fireball. The Trogg reared back, screeching like nothing Binky had ever heard. The smell of burnt fur filled Binky’s lungs. The Trogg was hurt, but undeterred. It regained its composure, picked up its club, and advanced once more on Binky, this time, more cautiously. “Please just let it be quick.” He thought.<br>

“Form up boys, there’s some commotion over there!”<br>

Voices! For a brief moment, Binky could taste safety. “Over here!” He yelled, “Help!”<br>

The Trogg sensed the approaching danger. Moving erratically, it lurched towards Binky. He closed his eyes once more, waiting for the final blow to strike him.<br>

BANG.<br>

Time stood still for a moment. The smell of gunpowder lingered in the air. Binky opened his eyes. The Trogg stumbled, and then fell to the floor, its body writhing in pain.<br>

“Get that Gnome out of there!”<br>

“Sir, yes, sir!”<br>

Two Gnomes burst into the shop, dressed in the full regalia of the Gnomeregan 5th Artillery Corps. The taller Gnome’s gun was still smoking as he set it down next to bookcase.<br>

“What’s your name son?”<br>

“Binky.”<br>

“Binky, huh? Well I’m known to these chaps as Tuftsworth, but you can call me Tufty. This here’s Togglevolt.” Said the taller Gnome.<br>

Togglevolt nodded in Binky’s direction.<br>

“Your quite tough for a small one” Said Tufty, pulling Binky to his feet.<br>

The two soldiers carried Binky outside, presenting him before yet another member of the Gnomish military.<br>

“Found one Sarge’”<br>

“Good work boys.” The Sergeant turned to Binky. “Didn’t you hear about the evacuation?”<br>

“Evactuation?” enquired Binky.<br>

“Yes, we’re leaving the city. Immediately.” replied the Sergeant, “The radiation is sweeping the city as we speak. Anyone left behind will become a braindead lump. We need to move to higher ground. NOW!”<br>

“Radiation? Braindead?” Binky’s brain had taken just about all it could for the day.

“I’ll explain later lad. Boys, get him to the surface, and get the medics to take a look at that leg of his” Barked the Sergeant.

“Sir, yes, sir!” Chimed the two Gnomes.

As the soldiers hit their Gnomish Location Reconfigurators, Binky saw the Cogwheel for the last time, the familiar signs and windows whirling around him as they began to translocate. He blinked. Twice. Then passed out.</p>
